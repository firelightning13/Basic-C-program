# My own exercises and projects C file archived are finally here... 
_(Only specific for CFS IIUM students)_

I thought I would give a cheat sheet for people who are really lost on programming classes lol. Not to brag, but these files is very useful. Include my comments btw, for more reader-friendly. _(ignore those file names though)_

Just hit the green button to download the whole thing _(or just click one of the files to view them)_ and have a good read. You can also compile and run to check them out. It'll always work guaranteed 100%

### Requirements:
1. Your laptop or desktop PC _(dunno about Mac Pro though, sorry Apple fans)_
2. Windows XP _(why not, it's not a big deal)_ or Windows 10
3. [**Dev-C++**](https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/) _(pls save as .c instead of .cpp)_
4. Basic computery stuff and C language
5. Your logic skills _(not for close-minded people >:( )_

### File names xplain:
- [**bingomatch.c**](https://github.com/firelightning13/Basic-C-program/blob/master/bingomatch.c) - one of the project titles "Bingo Match" (not my project, just helping other people by scratching my head)
- [**chapter 4 problem 4.c**](https://github.com/firelightning13/Basic-C-program/blob/master/chapter%204%20problem%204.c) - one of the people named *\*insert a girl name here\** attempted to do chapter 4 problem 4 _(complete but abundance of function calls, comments are just malay-ish)_ **(use [problem4.4.c](https://github.com/firelightning13/Basic-C-program/blob/master/problem4.4.c) instead)**
- **ex4.1.c to ex4.6.c** - lecturer gave us exercise for topic "Functions", I only do programming problems _(i hate pencil)_
- **ex4.6 - Copy.c** - oops, i shouldn't upload it here
- [**ex5.17.c**](https://github.com/firelightning13/Basic-C-program/blob/master/ex5.17.c) - same as ex4.x, but with the topic "Array", how to use and sort array
- **[ex6.1.c](https://github.com/firelightning13/Basic-C-program/blob/master/ex6.1.c) and [ex6.2.c](https://github.com/firelightning13/Basic-C-program/blob/master/ex6.2.c)** - same as ex4.x and ex5.17, but with the topic "String"
- [**lol.c**](https://github.com/firelightning13/Basic-C-program/blob/master/lol.c) - a copy of bingomatch.c, i dunno why but i should just delete it
- [**lol2.c**](https://github.com/firelightning13/Basic-C-program/blob/master/lol2.c) - a smaller version of ex5.17, sorting array only
- [**oof.c**](https://github.com/firelightning13/Basic-C-program/blob/master/oof.c) - one of the code block from one of the project titles "Document Analyzer ver.whatever", testing out "strtok" function _(i scratch my head the most here, you can see my comment rambling here lol)_
- [**problem4.4.c**](https://github.com/firelightning13/Basic-C-program/blob/master/problem4.4.c) - One of the programming exercises for the topic "Functions", better documentation than "chapter 4 problem 4.c"
- **problem6.1.c - problem6.5.c** - One of the programming exercises for the topic "Strings"

when you're here, you're you're here
